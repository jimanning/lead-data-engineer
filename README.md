#Lead Data Engineer - central London based.#

##Who we are##

Connected Homes builds products at the intersection of energy and the internet-of-things. We put people in control of their heating with Hive (http://hivehome.com); help customers understand and tailor their energy use through our Smart Energy Report; and are busy developing more products which connect people with their homes. 

##What we need##

We are looking for  a Lead Data Engineer to run our Data Platform team who are building the next generation greenfield Data Platform for Connected Homes. It’s a greenfield project so there will be considerable scope to influence the outcome through your tech lead; data engineering skills; and knowledge of open-source technologies.

The platform will be Connected Homes end ­to ­end data solution - streaming data from internet-­of-­things sensors, clickstreams and other high volume sources; validating and storing; aggregating and processing; providing a platform to run data -science algorithms; and delivering data back to applications; third parties and other systems via restful API’s

##Experience##

You’ll have a background in working with high volume data. You’ll have designed and built data processing pipelines; have war stories from ETL projects; and have dealt with databases at scale.

You’ll be working with a small team. So whilst its vital that you can play a technical leadership role and clearly set out technical direction, you will be hands-on and delivery-focussed working alongside the rest of the team to build and integrate the components of the platform.

You will be familiar with writing production quality code to move, manipulate and present data. The majority of code in the data platform will be JVM based. Specifically, you’ll be an experienced Scala developer with a history of using it to build data pipelines and components. However familiarity with other JVM based languages and Python will be required.

The data platform is being built around Datastax Cassandra, but will almost certainly make use of other database technologies - MySQL and possibly MongoDb. You’ll feel at home working with these day to day, constructing queries etc. You’ll be able to point to projects where you designed and implemented schema’s. Familiarity with optimisation would be a bonus.  		 	 	 		
Knowledge of parallel processing methods is a must have. You’ll be able to demonstrate building and implementing aggregation and other data manipulation processes using map-reduce based algorithms. Experience of the Hadoop ecosystem of tools (Hive, Pig etc) in a production environment is a must, but you’ll also have experimented with newer technologies - Spark, Spark streaming, Shark etc.
